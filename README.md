# Meliora
Meliora is a Latin adjective meaning "better". It is the neuter plural (nominative or accusative) form of the adjective "melior, -or, -us".

It may be used in the accusative and substantively (i.e., as a noun) to mean "better things", "always better", "ever better", or, more fully, "for the pursuit of the better".

It is also the motto[1] of University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, voted for by the faculty in 1851 and translated as "ever better" or "always better".
